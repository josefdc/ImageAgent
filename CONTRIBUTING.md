4. Set up the required environment variables (e.g., API keys)
5. Run tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` for new features
  - üêõ `:bug:` for bug fixes
  - üìù `:memo:` for documentation updates
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` for refactoring code
  - üß™ `:test_tube:` for adding tests

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
- Keep line length to a maximum of 88 characters (compatible with Black formatter)
- Run the project's linting tools before submitting PRs:
  ```bash
  # If using flake8
  flake8 .
  
  # If using black
  black .
  ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```text
image-editor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                     # Main Streamlit app entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/                     # Additional app pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent/                     # LangGraph Agent implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                      # Core image processing & AI service logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/                     # Streamlit session state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                        # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                     # Utility functions and constants
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                     # Unit/Integration tests
```

When adding new features:
1. Core image processing functions should go in `core/processing.py`
2. New AI service integrations should go in `core/ai_services.py` 
3. Agent tools should be defined in `agent/tools.py`
4. UI components should be placed in the `ui/` directory
